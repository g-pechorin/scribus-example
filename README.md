

I'm trying to replace text in a [Scribus](https://www.scribus.net/) document.

The instructions from the docs said to do one thing ... but that didn't work.

The file [`script-logs.py`](script-logs.py) shows a detailed and noisy set of logs as I attempt to follow [complaint driven debugging]().
The loggy (loggie?) version could still be a useful stepping stone for other diagnostics.
The final (working and concise) example is [for all to see as `script-final.py`](script-final.py) which I offer as a demonstration of my divinity.
